Summary:Simple webcam
Description:
Use your Android as a simple mobile webcam or cloudcam via WIFI or Mobile Network.
Upload pics with ftp or store on your sdcard to create a timelapse video (the http
and email options may not work in this build though).

Use as simple but mobile timed webcam with refresh rates from seconds to hours, with 
motion detection or your defined daily activity times. High resolution pictures are 
also possible. Mark the pictures with text or image to advertise for your place or business.

The proprietary Google AdMobSDK was replaced with a dummy library.
