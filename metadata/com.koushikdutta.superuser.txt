Summary:Manage root access
Description:
An app to allow or disallow apps' request to run as root, like the
Superuser app that comes with custom ROMs. The difference here is
that the entire app can be built from source with the Android
SDK, including the '''su''' binary which is bundled within. The app
also intends to enforce an Android root permission that can be
managed like any other permission. Should work with both ARM and x86.
