Summary:Todoist.com client
Description:
[todoist.com Todoist.com] offers task management that is accessible via apps such as this, the website 
or desktop brower plugins. The free version has certain limitations like lack of SSL and the inability
to add notes to tasks. A premium version costs $30 a year. It is possible to create an account quickly 
within the app if you just want to try it out. This app is an unnofficial client and the official apps 
are not FOSS.

* Offline support (syncs with Todoist servers)
* Filter by projects, labels and queries
* Sort items by due date
* View and edit notes
* Edit labels
* View completed items as well
* Backup & restore Todoist data frequently
* Many options for initial view (last used label/project, specific label/project, and many more)

* Phone numbers, email and website addresses in items and notes are turned into clickable links
