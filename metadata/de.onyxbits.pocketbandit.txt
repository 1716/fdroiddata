Summary:Slot-machine game
Description:
A comic style slot machine game. The game is
modelled after the classic, three reel, ten stops slot machines, made
popular by Mills Novelty. Unlike its mechanical cousins, Pocket Bandit is 
not entirely luck based, but also offers elements of skill and strategy game play.
