Summary:Wireless internet tethering
Description:
This is the latest version of [[android.tether]] but it's still a beta.

This program enables tethering (via WiFi and BT) for rooted handsets running Android. Clients (your 
laptop for example) can connect (via ad-hoc mode) and get access to the internet using the cellular 
data connection which is established by the handset.

This application requires a rooted device (basic Android still doesn't allow ad-hoc mode) and 
(probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables). Please see the website for detailed 
information.
