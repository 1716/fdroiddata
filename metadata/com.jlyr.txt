Summary:Get lyrics
Description:
You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the
app or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler like
[[net.jjc1138.android.scrobbler]] or [[com.adam.aslfms]] installed then JLyr can detect
what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically. The app is also able
to detect what the stock Android Music app is playing, without a Scrobbler.
