Description:
You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the
app or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler like 
[[net.jjc1138.android.scrobbler]] or [[com.adam.aslfms]] installed then JLyr can detect 
what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically.
