Name:Hacker's Keyboard
Auto Name:Hacker\'s Keyboard
Summary:5-row keyboard
Description:
A five row soft-keyboard with additional punctuation, and tab and ctrl keys.
There are about thirty different layouts possible. The keyboard has separate number keys,
punctuation in the usual places, and arrow keys. It is based on the AOSP Gingerbread
soft keyboard, so it supports multitouch for the modifier keys.

Completion dictionaries are provided by plug-in packages, available from the website.
The keyboard also supports use of dictionaries (but not keyboard layouts) provided
by [[com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard]] language packs.

The permissions requested by the application are those needed by the underlying Gingerbread
keyboard. It uses the contacts information for completion of names and email addresses, and
audio recording for the voice input feature.
