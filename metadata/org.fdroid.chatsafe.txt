Summary:SMS encryption
Description:
'''N.B'''This recipe isn't complete. app_name for Arabic and Tibetan
need fixing: also new icons are needed.

'''N.B'''ChatSafe is a re-branded version of TextSecure. The author
doesn't want the latter being distributed via f-droid.org. If
you have any problems with our build don't look for support from them.

ChatSafe is a drop-in replacement for the standard text messaging application
allowing you to send and receive text messages as normal. All text messages
sent or received with ChatSafe are stored in an encrypted database on your
phone, and text messages are encrypted during transmission when communicating
with someone else also using ChatSafe.
