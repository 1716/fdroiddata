Summary:Augmented reality browser
Description:
Point the camera and see what's around. Uses a variety of sources, including Wikipedia , Twitter,
OpenStreetMap and mixare.org. The Google Maps don't seem to display on v0.9.2, maybe it requires a 
key to be placed in the source code. However versions after v0.9.2 have the option to use OSM maps instead.
