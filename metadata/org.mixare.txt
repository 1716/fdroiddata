Summary:Augmented reality browser
Description:
Point the camera and see what's around. Uses a variety of sources, including Wikipedia , Twitter,
OpenStreetMap and mixare.org. Versions after 0.9.2 use a different repository which avoids the Google Maps
requirement and use OSM instead. (This is not fully implemented yet.). Needless to say Google Maps don't
function in the f-droid build.
