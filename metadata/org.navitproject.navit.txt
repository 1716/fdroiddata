Description:
It's modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats
for routing and rendering of the displayed map. It's even possible to
use multiple maps at a time.

The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your
destination, but also generates directions and even speaks to you.

Navit currently speaks 27 languages.
