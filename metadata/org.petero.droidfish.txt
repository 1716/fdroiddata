Summary:Chess program
Description:
Port of the CuckooChess applet/engine. By default the app uses the Stockfish chess engine
but the F-droid build has somehow broken that, so you'll have to use the CuckooChess engine instead. 
A fully functioning apk can be downloaded from the website.

If you have [[org.scid.android]] installed you can read Scid database files directly from the
app by long-pressing the board and choosing Load game from Scid file.
