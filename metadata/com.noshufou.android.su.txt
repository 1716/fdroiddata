Summary:Grant and manage Superuser rights for your phone.
Description:
Hook into your phone's power.

Any app that requires root access must call the su binary which in turn calls this app to prompt the user for permission. This app is also used to manage which apps have root permission as well as monitor their usage of the permission.

This app requires that you already have root, or a custom recovery image to work.

Note: App and binary will have different versions. The app is updated more often than the binary is.

Requires Root:Yes
