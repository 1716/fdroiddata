Summary:Privacy-enhanced browser
Description:
Orweb is a companion browser to [[org.torproject.android]], the port of Tor to Android. Tor 
anonymizes internet traffic by routing it through many different stages and you must have that 
enabled first. Orweb disables certain other browser features that could be used to identify you.
