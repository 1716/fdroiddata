Summary:Music player
Description:
Comprehensive music player with unusual features such as: sharing files over Android Beam, now-playing to 
Twitter and automatic playback on headphone insertion. By installing the optional 
[[jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer.ds.podcast]] and/or [[jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer.ds.ampache]]
you can listen to audio from those sources. For example with the latter, you 
can store your music on an Owncloud server and stream it to Just-Player.

This version of Just-Player requires  Android 3.0+ and later versions of the app require GCM and ad
libraries so it may be a while before we can update the app
.
