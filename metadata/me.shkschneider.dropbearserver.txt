Summary:An SSH server, based on dropbear
Description:
It allows you to easily install, configure and run a Secured SHell on your Android phone.
SSH is a secured (encrypted) protocol that is used on millions of GNU/Linux servers to issue commands remotely.

If you don’t know what ‘root’ or ‘ssh’ means, you should not install this!

* You will be able to gain shell access, just like ‘adb shell’
* You will be able to put and pull files via ‘scp’ or similar

This rich front-end to DropBear allows you to easily configure tons of things:

* Allows root access (optional)
* Allows non-root access (sdcard read/write)
* Install DropBear
* Start/Stop the server
* Manage credentials (publickeys or master password)
* Loads public keys from SDCard
* and much more!
.

Requires Root:Yes
