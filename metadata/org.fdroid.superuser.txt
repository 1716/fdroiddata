Summary:Manage root access
Description:
'''N.B'''We don't provide a flashable zip that could be flashed
in the event that something goes wrong. You can try the 
Google Play description for a link to the developer's zip. 
You must already have root for this to work.

An app to allow or disallow apps' request to run as root, like the
Superuser app that comes with custom ROMs. The difference here is
that the entire app can be built from source with the Android
SDK, including the '''su''' binary which is bundled within and
copied to /system when the prompts are followed. The app
also intends to enforce an Android root permission that can be
managed like any other permission. Should work with both ARM and x86.
.

Requires Root:Yes
