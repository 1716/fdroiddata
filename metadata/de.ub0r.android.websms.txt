Summary:Send texts via the WWW
Description:
WebSMS lets you send free and cheap TXT via different webservices.

You will need at least one WebSMS Connector (plugin/extension) to connect this app to the webservice 
of your choice. We have a couple in the repo but there is source code for many on the author's source
code page and apks are available on the website. As WebSMS is not able to read messages you might 
find [[de.ub0r.android.smsdroid]] useful.

Pricing depends on the webservice provider connected with the connector.
The “SMS” Connector shipped with the app itself sends messages via standard GSM method and 
is billed by your operator. It is installed for backup reasons and deactivated by default.

The Google Admob library in the source code of this app has been replaced with the MobAdMob open-source
library that does nothing.
