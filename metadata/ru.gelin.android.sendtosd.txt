Summary:Copy things to the local storage
Description:
This adds an item to the share menu to save the object to the sdcard. For example, let's say you place a memory 
card in the phone to look at some pictures. You look at them in the gallery and as you go you copy the good 
ones to the internal memory. Not all things will be saved as expected: a webpage will only have it's url saved.
