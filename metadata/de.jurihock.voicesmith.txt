Summary:Real-time voice changer and Altered Auditory Feedback
Description:
Voicesmith records an audio signal from the built-in microphone, processes it in some way and plays it back through the earphones. There are some of the classical Phase Vocoder effects available. Voicesmith can also be used to perform the Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) and Frequency-Shifted Auditory Feedback (FAF).
