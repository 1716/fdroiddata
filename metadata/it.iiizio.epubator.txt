Summary:Offline PDF to ePUB convertor
Description:
* ePUBator extracts text from a PDF file and puts it in a well formed (epubcheck compliant) ePUB file.
* PDF extraction is based on iText library http://itextpdf.com/ released under the AGPL license.
* ePUBator doesn't need internet connection.
* ePUBator doesn't send your docs somewhere on the net.
* ePUBator extracts text (no text in pictures or in raster PDF).
* ePUBator tries to extract images (only png, jpg and gif) but puts them at the page's end.
* ePUBator tries to extract the table of contents if present (or creates a dummy TOC).
* ePUBator doesn't extract the font size and style.
* ePUBator works fine with single column PDF (can work bad with multi column or tables).
* ePUBator can fail extraction (5 of 358 books with v0.8.1 on my Atrix).
* ePUBator IS MADE FOR BOOKS, NOT FOR EVERY TYPE OF PDF (DON'T ASK IT TOO MUCH).

In the event of crash, unexpected stoppages or insufficient memory try setting Page per file to 1 
and/or disable the extraction of images and try again (sometimes helps).
