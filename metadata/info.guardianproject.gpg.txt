Summary:Gnupg for Android
Description:
This builds an app which is not ready for prime time, but it also builds binaries that
are used by Lil'Debi, which is external/data/data/info.guardianproject.gpg/\
app_opt/bin/gpg2-static. F-droid build server requires dependencies to build this however\
so it can't be included in the Lil'Debi build for now.
