There are many language packs and themes available as apks on the website. There are instructions
on the [https://code.google.com/p/softkeyboard/wiki/HowToCreateLanguagePack wiki] for creating a pack from 
the source code: it involves editing the keyboard layout xml file and adding a dictionary. Only a couple
of the addon packs have their full source code published.
