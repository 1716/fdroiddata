Auto Name:Mustard {MOD}
Summary:Microblogging app
Description:
Client for [http://status.net/wiki/Take_a_tour StatusNet] 
(now known as [http://www.gnu.org/software/social GNU social]). 
GNU social is a microblogging platform somewhat like Twitter, 
but decentralized.
Some examples are: [https://status.fsf.org fsf.org], 
[https://sn.jpope.org jpope.org] and [http://bka.li bka.li].
The latter is in German, as is the website.

Twitter is disabled in this build, but in future versions
it will be possible to enter oAuth credentials into the app, after
registering your own client at dev.twitter.com.
It is already possible to add oAuth credentials for StatusNet sites.
