Summary:Extensible lock screen widget
Description:
DashClock is a replacement lock screen clock widget for Android 4.2+. It also
exposes additional status items called extensions. The widget comes bundled
with extensions that give you instant access to:
* Missed calls and unread text messages
* Your next calendar appointment
* Your next scheduled alarm
The local weather extension requires Network Location which is a non-free
system app. That's found on devices alongside the other proprietary Google
services though its functionality can be disabled through the Location Settings.

To add the widget to your Android 4.2 device's lock screen, simply swipe to the
left-most page of your lock screen and touch the "+" icon. Then, select
"DashClock" to customize and add the widget. You can make this the primary lock
screen widget, replacing the default clock, by first touching-and-holding it
and then dragging it horizontally to the very rightmost position.
