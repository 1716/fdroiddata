Summary:Wireless internet tethering
Description:
This program enables tethering (via wifi) for "rooted" handsets running android (such as the Android DevPhone 1). Clients (your laptop for example) can connect via wifi (ad-hoc mode)and get access to the internet using the 3G, 2G mobile connection which is established by the handset.

This application requires a "rooted"-device and(probably) a custom-kernel which supports netfilter (iptables)! Please see the FAQ for detailed information.
