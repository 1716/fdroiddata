Blank lines indicate a new paragraph and it is preferrable to make a new
line for a new sentence.
It is applicable to what would be the Recommended Version for most people 
i.e. the version that's closest to the Current Version (see below) and als
compatible with their device.

The description should be: 
* Fairly future proof, unless you intend to keep it updated 
* Not be too short 
* With a  maximum line length of 80 chars, unless the basic MediaWiki markup is used

The following extra are examples of items that may be helpful:

periodically to a server whose location is hard-coded into the app.
