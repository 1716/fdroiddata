Summary:Geocaching client
Description:
Geocaching is a sport where people hide things and you go and find them. This is an unnofficial client to 
access geocaching.com's list of caches, search and save them to the device. This build will not display Google 
Maps because F-droid is not allowed to distribute the API keys. However OSM maps (Mapnik and Cyclemap) are available.
You will also need a geocaching.com account to the unlock the exact location of the caches, and a premium membership to
sort caches by distance.
