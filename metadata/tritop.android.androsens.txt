Summary:Read data from sensors
Description:
Why would you need this? Well if you ever get stuck under an avalanche this could show you the right direction to start digging. Or if your smartphone has very accurate magnetic field sensors you can use this to find submerged submarines. If you're not sure if the sensors on your smartphone are working you can use this app to find out.
