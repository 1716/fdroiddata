Summary:Secure calling app
Description:
RedPhone is an application that enables encrypted voice communication between
RedPhone users. RedPhone integrates with the system dialer to provide a
frictionless call experience, but uses ZRTP to setup an encrypted VoIP channel
for the actual call. RedPhone was designed specifically for mobile devices,
using audio codecs and buffer algorithms tuned to the characteristics of mobile
networks, and using push notifications to maximally preserve your device's
battery life while still remaining responsive.
