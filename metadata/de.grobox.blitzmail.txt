Summary:Share content via email with just one click
Description:
BlitzMail is an Android app that allows you to set up your email account once and then use it to send emails to an address of your choice. This comes in handy when you need to send a lot of things via email, because you are in a low connectivity area (e.g. subway) and want to remember things to look at later.

The SMTP password is stored encrypted with a built-in key and salted with your device ID. This is not fully secure, but should provide reasonable protection for your password.
