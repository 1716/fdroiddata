Summary:Wallet for the Bitcoin currency
Description:
N.B The recommended version here is quite old. We will be updating it
soon and it would be wise to wait for that.

* No cloud server or web service needed. This wallet works peer to peer
* Display of wallet balance in Bitcoin and various other currencies
* Sending and receiving of Bitcoin via NFC, QR-codes or Bitcoin URLs
* Address book for regularly used Bitcoin addresses
* Enter transactions while offline, will be executed when online
* Manages blockchain on your device (for security, but see below)
* System notifications for Bitcoin connectivity and received coins
* App widget for Bitcoin balance (requirement: app moved from sdcard to phone)

The initial blockchain setup downloads several
gigabytes of data, so make sure you use WiFi! The actual blockchain takes
20MiB of storage,
and the app is installed to the sdcard by default. When run for the first
time, it can
happen that the app shows only a white display for some seconds.

Since v2.41 it is able to export private keys to local storage, encrypted
with a password. It also uses bloom filtering to reduce the amount of data
that needs to be downloaded to set up the blockchain.

See the
[http://bitcoin-wallet.googlecode.com/git/wallet/README Readme] for details.
Use this at your own risk, and be aware that if you lose access to the data
of this application, you will lose any Bitcoins contained in it. To back up
the wallet, either;

# (From inside the app), export the keys to the sdcard (v2.41+ only)
# Use ADB from the Android SDK if you have Android 4.1+ on the phone (root not required, but check that it works properly), or
# Manually back up the files in /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files/: #tar cf /sdcard/wallet.tar /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files and you may have to change the ownership of the files that you restore. (root required. You can also back up the blockchain in this way.)

There's a separate version of this application that uses a test version of the
Bitcoin network. It would be wise to use that first, to verify that everything
works for you without using real Bitcoins.
