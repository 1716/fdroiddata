Summary:Wallet for the Bitcoin currency
Description:
Since v2.41 it is able to export private keys to local storage, encrypted
with a password. It also uses bloom filtering, reducing drastically the 
amount of data that needs to be downloaded to set up the blockchain.
With v3 a new wallet format is used using a lot less storage but if you
are upgrading, the blockchain will need reseting. When run for the first
time, it can happen that the app shows only a white display for some seconds.

* No cloud server or web service needed. This wallet works peer to peer
* Display of wallet balance in Bitcoin and various other currencies
* Sending and receiving of Bitcoin via NFC, QR-codes or Bitcoin URLs
* Address book for regularly used Bitcoin addresses
* Enter transactions while offline, will be executed when online
* Manages blockchain on your device 
* System notifications for Bitcoin connectivity and received coins
* App widget for Bitcoin balance (requirement: app moved from sdcard to phone)

See the
[http://bitcoin-wallet.googlecode.com/git/wallet/README Readme] for details.
Use this at your own risk, and be aware that if you lose access to the data
of this application, you will lose any Bitcoins contained in it. To back up
the wallet, either;

# (From inside the app), export the keys to the sdcard (v2.41+ only). After restoring, the app may download some tens of MiB of data to regenerate the blockchain
# Use ADB backup from the Android SDK if you have Android 4+ on the phone (root not required, but check that it works properly: since v2 is installed to sdcard by default, the shared storage needs backing up too), or
# Manually back up the files in /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files/: #tar cf /sdcard/wallet.tar /data/data/de.schildbach.wallet/files and you may have to change the ownership of the files that you restore (root required)

There's a separate version of this application that uses a test version of the
Bitcoin network. It would be wise to use that first, to verify that everything
works for you without using real Bitcoins.
