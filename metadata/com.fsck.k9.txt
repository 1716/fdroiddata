Auto Name:K-9 Mail
Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP.  Packed
with features and highly configurable.  Import and export of settings is
possible so that all that's required to setup the app after a wipe is to enter
the account passwords.

If you would like to contribute financially to k9mail, please consider
donating to the local SPCA (Societies for the prevention of cruelty to
animals).

We leave this app as a developer build to minimize the disruption to users a
signature switch would cause. Building the app from source is very
straightforward though.  Stable releases are numbered x.even and they are
maintained in their own git branches.

Current development versions are based on the Android 4 email client. When that
becomes stable we will probably only offer a source-built version with
a different package name.
