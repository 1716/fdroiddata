Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP. Packed with
features and highly configurable. Import and export of settings is possible so that all that's
required to setup the app after a wipe is to enter the account passwords.

If you would like to contribute financially to k9mail, please consider donating to the local SPCA
(Societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals).

We leave this app as a developer build to minimize the disruption to users a signature switch
would cause. Building the app from source is very straightforward though. Stable releases are
numbered x.even and they are maintained in their own git branches.
