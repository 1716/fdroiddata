Auto Name:K-9 Mail
Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
This is the K-9 mail development team's build. For a better update experience
via F-Droid, we recommend switching to the F-Droid build: [[org.fdroid.k9]]. 
You can install it alongside this version, and easily migrate your accounts 
and settings.

E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP.  Packed
with features and highly configurable.  Import and export of settings is
possible so that all that's required to setup the app after a wipe is to enter
the account passwords.
