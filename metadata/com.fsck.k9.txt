Name:K-9 Mail (dev)
Auto Name:K-9 Mail
Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
This is the K-9 Mail development team's build. For a better update experience
via F-Droid, we recommend switching to the F-Droid build: [[org.fdroid.k9]]. 
You can install it alongside this version, and easily migrate your accounts 
and settings.

E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP.
Can do encryption if [[org.thialfihar.android.apg]] is installed.
Settings and account configurations can be exported so that they can be imported
easily if you are switching packages/signatures: a file manager will need to be 
already installed to achieve this.

If you would like to contribute financially to k9mail, consider 
donating to the local SPCA (Societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals).
