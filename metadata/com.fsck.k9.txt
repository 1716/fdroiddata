Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
N.B if you are installing the newer version that is built from source, you must uninstall the one you have as it's signed with a different key. Not to worry though as K9mail is able to export all your settings; you only need to re-enter your passwords after you import them into the new version.

Email client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP, Push IMAP. Packed with
features and highly configurable.
