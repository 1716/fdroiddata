Summary:Robust communication using wifi
Description:
Mobile communications are useful, but depend on infrastructure that can be damaged, overwhelmed, 
or even absent. This app assumes zero infrastructure: the phones talk to each other, 
relaying calls, and resolving numbers for each other. A cellular commons using the unique 
Serval Mesh telephony software that allows you to use your existing phone number.

* Can be carried and activated in seconds by those who need it when it is needed
* Carrier independent
* Can be distributed during an emergency from only one phone 
* Distributed nature makes network resilient

Ideal for remote, rural & impoverished communities, and disaster/emergency situations, and the 
services that support them, the software is making the best of one of the most ubiquitous 
of devices - the mobile phone. Turn your phone into a true communications device - anytime, anywhere.

This is experimental software and currently requires root access. To avail of the maps feature
a separate app has to be installed which isn't in the repo yet.
