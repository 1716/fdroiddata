Auto Name:Serval Mesh
Summary:Peer to peer communications
Description:
'''N.B''' Some elements of the source code such as ifconfig are not built
from source, but likely will be in future. The messaging part
is working in the latest version.

This is experimental software and currently requires root access: please see
the warnings in the README
of the source code. It may not work as advertised; it may lose or alter
messages and files that it carries;
it may consume a lot of space, speed and battery; and it may crash unexpectedly.
To avail of the maps feature a separate app has to be installed which isn't
in the f-droid.org repo yet.

Mobile communications are useful, but depend on infrastructure that can be
damaged, overwhelmed,
or even absent. This app assumes zero infrastructure. The phones talk to each
other using WiFi;
relaying calls and messages and figuring out how to resolve numbers. In other
words, it lets your phone
communicate with other Android phones running Serval Mesh within WiFi range.

* Can be carried and activated in seconds by those who need it when it is needed
* Carrier independent
* Can be distributed during an emergency from only one phone
* Distributed nature makes network resilient

Ideal for remote, rural and impoverished communities; disaster/emergency
situations, and the
services that support them: the software is making the best of one of the most
ubiquitous
of devices - the mobile phone. Turn your phone into a true communications
device; anytime, anywhere.

Requires root: Ideally. Basic Android still doesn't allow WiFi in AdHoc mode,
so the app will enable it
if you allow it root. It can function without root permission, but will be
limited to using an
existing WiFi home network or hot spot, and may not work altogether.

The Java/XML part is distributable under the GNU GPLv3 while the serval-dna
project is GPLv2.
