Summary:Barcode scanner for MusicBrainz Picard
Description:
Load releases into MusicBrainz Picard by using your phone as a barcode
scanner. When scanning the barcode of an album, the app will search
MusicBrainz for matching releases and load them into Picard on your desktop
computer.

This is especially useful if you have your physical music collection already
digitalized and want to tag the files using exactly the album you own.

Please note: This is not a music file tagger for Android but rather a helper
tool for MusicBrainz Picard on your desktop.
Requirements:
* Picard 1.0 or later
* The ZXing barcode scanner
* Your phone and the computer running Picard should be both on the same
 network, and the port 8000 should be accessible

It is also worth noting that, in order for this app to work, you need to
install [[com.google.zxing.client.android]], which is not shown by default as
it promotes Non-Free Add-ons.
