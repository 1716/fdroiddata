Summary:Remote control for BitTorrent clients
Description:
Transdroid is an Android remote client for your torrent application running on a
server or home computer. Currently Transmission, uTorrent, Bittorrent, Deluge, Vuze
and rTorrent are supported. It can show the active torrents, pause, resume or remove
them and new torrents can be added via URL, RSS feed or using the integrated search.

Anti-Feature: Tracking. It will connect to transdroid.org as
soon as you run it, and periodically after that. Information exposed is probably
limited to your IP address, OS version and Transdroid version.
