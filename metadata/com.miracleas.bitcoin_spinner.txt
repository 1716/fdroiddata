Summary:Lightweight bitcoin wallet
Description:
Send and receive Bitcoins using QR codes. Share your Bitcoin address using 
Gmail, Twitter and more. Backup/restore wallet using QR codes. The blockchain 
is not downloaded, but is kept track of by a remote server. All your Bitcoins 
are protected using private keys stored on your device using app private storage
. BitcoinSpinner is NOT an on-line Bitcoin Bank. Nobody can run away with your 
Bitcoins. It is implemented on top of the BCCAPI, which means that all the heavy 
lifting associated with managing the block chain is hosted by a server. The server 
side is not in any position to spend your Bitcoins, as all private keys are stored
 in your device. This beta software so don't put the life savings in there.
