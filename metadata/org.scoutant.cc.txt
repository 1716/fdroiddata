Summary:Board game
Description:
A traditional strategy game to be played on a tablet.
Play with up to 6 players, or against the machine.

The objective is to be first to race one's pieces across the gameboard.
Each player has ten pieces.
Players take turns moving a single piece, either by moving one step to an
adjacent unoccupied space or by jumping in one of any number of available
consecutive hops over other single pieces.
There is no capturing, so hopped pieces remain active on the gameboard.
