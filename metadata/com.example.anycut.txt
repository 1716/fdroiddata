Summary:Create shortcuts for anything
Description:
You can make shortcuts for anything that has an activity e.g Android keyboard settings screen. All activities
are listed but there is no description of what each does, so you'll just have to take a guess and some
may not do anything. In addition you can make shortcuts to directly dial or send an sms to a contact.
