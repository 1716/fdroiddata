Summary:MSX emulator
Description:
MSX is a non IBM PC compatible computer architecture, which was popular mostly in Japan, the 
Middle East, the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent, several other European countries. Many 
popular titles, including [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry Wizardry], 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snatcher Snatcher], and initially, 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_%28series%29 the Metal Gear series] targeted 
MSX as their primary platform.

OpenMSX emulates wide range of MSX hardware. Built-in FOSS firmware supports *.rom images and 
allows using directories as drives. In order to run games for floppy drives (*.dsk images), as 
well as software, using exotic devices, you may have to acquire firmware files for those 
(misleadingly called "ROMs") and put them into 
/sdcard/Android/data/org.openmsx.android.openmsx/files/openmsx_system. Firmware files can be 
dumped from real machines or downloaded from the net. It is possible to create and use hardware 
descriptors and firmware for nonexisting configurations, such as so called 
[https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Modified_MSX2_EN Modified_MSX2_EN], which contains handful 
of drivers and have good (virtual) hardware capabilities.
