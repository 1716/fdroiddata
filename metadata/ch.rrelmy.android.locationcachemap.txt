Summary:Where was your device?
Description:
If you opt-in to Network location, the non-free software provided by Google to every Android phone,
a log will be kept of your location so that Google can benefit from the combination of location data and 
wireless signal data. 

The log can't be viewed against a map within the app because an API key for Google Maps is missing
from the f-droid.org build and no other map source is available. Another app that supports OpenStreetMap and 
gpx files can be used to view it, such as [[me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker]] or 
[[nl.sogeti.android.gpstracker]].
