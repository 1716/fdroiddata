Summary:Where was your device?
Description:
If you opt in to Network location, the nonfree software provided by Google to every Android phone,
a log will be kept of your location so that Google can benefit from the nexus of location data and 
wireless signal data. This app allows you to look at the data on your device in an easy way and export
the track for inspection elsewhere. You can see directly on a map what positions have been cached.
The cache can also be deleted and/or blocked.
