Summary:Where was your device?
Description:
If you opt in to Network location, the nonfree software provided by Google to every Android phone,
a log will be kept of your location so that Google can benefit from the nexus of location data and 
wireless signal data. This track can be exported inspection elsewhere and the cache can also be deleted 
and/or blocked.

N.B. The track can't be viewed within the app because an API key for Google Maps is missing.
You can still use another app that supports OpenStreetMap and gpx files to view it though, such as
[[me.guillaumin.android.osmtracker]] or [[nl.sogeti.android.gpstracker]].
