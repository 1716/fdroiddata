Summary:Download files from YouTube
Description:
Share a url from YouTube to this app and you will get the option
to download the media to your local storage in your choice of 
quality. Optionally,
you can send it via ssh to another computer. It isn't necessary
to have the YouTube app: URLs can be shared from the browser.

#Probably will only work for www.youtube.com, not for m.youtube.com
#i.e the desktop site only (or the non-free app). There is a
#link to the desktop site on the bottom of m.youtube.com.
