Summary:PSP emulator
Description:
PPSSPP is a PSP emulator for Android and other platforms. It is being
developed at a rapid speed and compatibility is increasing quickly, but there
are many games it doesn't run yet and it doesn't run fast on Android yet.
Please go to http://www.ppsspp.org for more information.
No games are included with this download, you will have to dump your own PSP
games and turn them into .ISO or .CSO files, or simply play free homebrew
games, which are available online.
