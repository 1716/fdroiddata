Summary:Geohash Droid is a simple Android Geohashing app.
Description:
Geohash Droid can auto-detect your graticule, calculate the day's meetup point, and follow you as you travel towards it.

Future features include tracking other people (at mutual discretion), storing a history of meetup points found, and automatically marking pictures taken near the point.

Oh, and achievement support. That's coming soonish.
