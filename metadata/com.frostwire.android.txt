Summary:Bittorrent client
Description:
Search and download files from the BitTorrent network and share files with other FrostWire users
on the same local network (via WiFi).

The non-Free Google Admob library in the source code has been replaced with an open-source library
that does nothing.
 
Anti-feature: Tracking. The app checks for new versions of the app without the user's consent and suggests
to install the update from an unknown source. The update won't work, however, because it is signed with
a different key.
