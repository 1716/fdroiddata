Summary:File-sharing and searching
Description:
Search and download files from the BitTorrent network and share files with
other FrostWire users
on the same local network (via WiFi). Frostwire can also be installed on
the desktop.

The non-free Google Admob library in the source code has been replaced with a
library
that does nothing.

Anti-feature: Tracking. The app checks for new versions of the app without the
user's consent.
The update won't work however, because it is signed with a different key to
these apks.
