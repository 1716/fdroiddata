Summary:Disable untrusted certificates
Description:
A slightly more vetted version of the Android CACert keystore. You can disable certificates that have been
revoked since your phone was bought such as those by the DigiNotar vendor. Android 4+ can do this too
from the main settings and root isn't required, so try that first.

***
This application requires root, as well as a device that has the ‘grep’ command on it. (check busybox)

If the ‘save’ doesn’t work, then you will need to make your /system partition read-write by using 
a file explorer like Ghost Commander or running something like  #mount -o remount,rw /system in the  terminal
***
.

Requires Root:Yes
