Summary:Disable untrusted certificates
Description:
An app to manage security certificates on your phone also containing a version of the Android CACert keystore
vetted by the Guardian Project. If a certificate has become untrusted you will need to install an update
to remain safe. However, the latest version of the vetted keystore can be grabbed from the source code page.
In addition, you can backup and remove certificates by yourself. Android 4+ allows you to disable certificates
from the main settings and root isn't required, so try that first if you want to manually mess with
the certificates.

This application requires root, as well as a device that has the ‘grep’ command on it. (check busybox)
If the ‘save’ doesn’t work, then you will need to make your /system partition read-write by using
a file explorer like Ghost Commander or running something like #mount -o remount,rw /system in the  terminal
.

Requires Root:Yes
