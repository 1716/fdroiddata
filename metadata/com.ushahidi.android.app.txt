Summary:Mapping tools
Description:
Ushahidi is a web and mobile platform that allows you to create, visualize and share stories on a map. 
It allows individuals to share their stories on their own terms using the tools they already have. 
Sync with any Ushahidi deployment. Send reports with images and location data as well as receive 
alerts from others who have sent in reports to the site.

The app supports loading of multiple deployments at one time, quick filtering through reports, 
exploring incident locations on the map, viewing report photos, news article, media as well as 
sharing reports via email, SMS or Twitter. Once the data has been downloaded, the app can function 
without an internet connection, allowing accurate collection of data utilizing the deviceâ€™s camera 
and GPS capabilities
.
