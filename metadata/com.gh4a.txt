Summary:GitHub Client
Description:
Formerly known as GH4A. This application is currently in BETA: please report any issues to the issue tracker.
Key highlights: easy navigation, breadcrumbs, clean and simple UI, parse README (currently only support 
Markdown). The app uses oAuth to authenticate: the keys are created via the initial password input, so
that the GitHub password isn't stored on the phone.
