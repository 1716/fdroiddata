Auto Name:Barcode Scanner
Summary:Barcode scanner
Description:
All web and product searches go to a Google domain (depending on the choice
of origin country), though a custom search button can be created in the
settings e.g. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s.
Scanning an ISBN barcode will display suggestions for Google Books and Amazon,
so unless you want to buy DRM-laden books from these re-sellers, it is best
to do a Web Search instead.

Supports:
* UPC-A and UPC-E
* EAN-8 and EAN-13
* Code 39; 93; 128
* ITF
* Codabar
* RSS-14 (all variants)
* QR Code
* Data Matrix
* Aztec ('beta' quality)
* PDF 417 ('alpha' quality)
(See the website for explanations of the permissions)

Anti-feature: Add-ons. It suggests the Google Shopper app to look up product
barcodes and asks you to download Barcode Scanner + from the settingsâ€”both of
which are non-free apps.
