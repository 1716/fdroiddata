Summary:Back up list of installed apps
Description:
Simple way to back up a list of installed applications to a file
on your SD card. The option to restore individual apps from this list is limited
to other app stores that are installed on the phone that can accept market intents.
It is not a good idea to restore apps already in the F-droid repo  using this method.
In most cases F-droid apps will have a different signature requiring you to uninstall
the app when switching between sources.
