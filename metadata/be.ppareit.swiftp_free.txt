Name:FTP Server
Summary:Access your phone wirelessly
Description:
This can actually work over the internet but the most likely usage is to access files from another 
computer without needing a cable. This is a fork of [[org.swiftp]] which is no longer being
developed. The name Demo in the launcher just means that it corresponds to the free version on
Google. The app is fully featured so instead of buying the "Full" version as a way of contributing
you can donate via the Paypal link.
