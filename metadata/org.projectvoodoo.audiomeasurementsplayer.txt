Summary:Tool for making audio measurements
Description:
Little app that plays RMAA and udial samples to ease Android devices sound performance measurements. 
In order to complete measurements, connect your phone or tablet headphone/line-out JACK to a computer with 
a high quality soundcard line-in then record the output manually or with RMAA program directly. Samples 
are compressed in lossless FLAC format to reduce APK size. Using this app instead of playing samples 
through a vendor or third-party music player lets you be sure no signal processing is done by the player.

If the manufacturer adds audio effects, youâ€™ll be able to spot them with confidence through measurement.
Without additional (like SRS, Beats audio) processing and if digital volume is maxed out, DAC will be fed by un-altered PCM data.
