Summary:Next version of the web browser
Description:
Mobile version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.  Uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages,
which implements current and anticipated web standards. Features include bookmark sync and custom search
engines.

N.B each version has several betas but only one of them is here. See the website for a link to the
ftp site to get the latest, and a list of compatible devices. This version is for ARMv7 architectures
only but the ftp server has versions that work on the more powerful ARMv6 devices.
