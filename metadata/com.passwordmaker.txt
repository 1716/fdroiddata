Summary:PasswordMaker for Android
Description:
N.B. Not related to PasswordMaker Pro. This won't be getting any more updates because the source
code is no longer available in a public repository.

PasswordMaker allows users to create and access unique, secure passwords. It is multi-platform and works 
by mixing the website url with unique info of your own choosing, such as a master password. The app 
creates an item in the share menu to quickly get at the password. For more info see passwordmaker.org.
