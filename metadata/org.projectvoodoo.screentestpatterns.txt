Auto Name:Voodoo Screen Test Patterns
Summary:Produce colours for testing
Description:
This app display simple colors on your Android device screen.
Those colors are then measured by a colorimeter or spectrophotometer
in order to build graphs or color profiles.

I recommend using free software Color HCFR:

but I guess alternative solutions like Calman or ChromaPure are fine
.
