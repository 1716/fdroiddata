Summary:Control network traffic
Description:
N.B. Due to an oversight, this app was included even though it includes some elements 
that are not built from source i.e. busybox and iptables binaries. The build is
left in, with the hope that a fully FOSS build can be provided soon, since the source
exists in the Droidwall repo.

Firewall (IPtables frontend), forked from DroidWall.
See [https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/blob/master/Changelog.md changelog] for news.

Requires root: Yes. iptables must run as root.
