Name: WarmShowers
Summary: A Community of Bicycle Tourists and Those Who Support Them
Description: |-
    The Warm Showers Community is a free worldwide hospitality exchange for touring cyclists. People who are willing to host touring cyclists sign up and provide their contact information, and may occasionally have someone stay with them and share great stories and a drink. All members agree to host others either now or in the future, but for some members hosting may be in years or even decades in their future.
    Members of Warmshowers.org can use this app to find hosts using both map and textual search interfaces. Hosts can be contacted directly through the app. Host information can also be downloaded and stored for offline usage.
    For more information on Warm Showers please [https://www.warmshowers.org see the website]. You must create an account on the site before being able to use this application! Visit https://www.warmshowers.org/user/register to sign up.
    We love to hear your experiences and suggestions, even problems! Contact us on the contact form - https://www.warmshowers.org/contact - or leave feedback here. Please mention that you're using the Android app, what version, what device, and the specific issue you're having.
