Summary:Augmented reality mountain identification
Description:
Augmented reality application which overlays the names of hills and mountains
on a camera view. Currently only has a database for hills of the UK and Ireland.

N.B The "birds eye", map overlay mode won't work because the only map source is Google Maps and that
would require an API key, to function which f-droid can't supply
.
