Name:Budget with envelopes
Auto Name:Budget
Summary:An app for managing money.
Description:
Avoid overdraft fees, unexpected shortages, the minimum payment treadmill, and that sinking dread when you realize you actually couldn't afford to go out.

That's what Budget is for, and it's easy.
You put money into the envelopes at payday, and take it out as you spend.
An envelope can represent anything â€” a bank account, money set aside for groceries, or the cash you're saving to buy that new Android phone off-contract.
Think of a checkbook, only more flexible.

Managing money is a drag, but it doesn't have to be painful or difficult.

Requires root: No.

Anti-features: None.

Supports x86 natively.
