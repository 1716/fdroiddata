Summary:Bus schedule for South Tyrol
Description:
SASAbus is the first application to consult the bus schedule of SASA (Società Autobus Servizi d'Area - 
Städtischer Autobus Service AG) for all lines of the city of Bozen, Meran and Leifers (South Tyrol).
Operation is very simple: choose the city, the bus line, the destination and the bus stop: SASAbus will 
show you the next bus stop schedule. Now with additional GPS mode. An other new feature is the qr-code reader,
 which allows you to read the qr-codes printed on the time tables attached on the busstops.

Data contained in the SQLite database which is downloaded on the initial startup are property of SASA SpA-AG 
and can be used exclusively by the application for the Android platform SASAbus version 0.1 or following 
versions. The usage of these data for other purposes must be autorized in advance by SASA SpA-AG; in any case 
the source of data for the usage or reproduction of graphs, tables or numerical values must be clearly 
indicated.
