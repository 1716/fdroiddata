Auto Name:Google I/O 2012
Summary:Google developer summit app
Description:
Every year Google holds a summitwhere they reveal the features in the next Android release.
We're a bit a late for this one, but Google didn't release the code until after
the summit finished anyway. It doesn't need Google Maps installed but it does
need a Google account on the phone.
