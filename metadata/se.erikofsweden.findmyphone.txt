Auto Name:FindMyPhone
Summary:Helps you find a mislaid phone
Description:
'''Only the *-fdroid build works with our K-9 package. Other versions work
with the official K-9 package'''

If you lose your phone having this app installed can help you find it. 
Upon receipt of an SMS or email, FindMyPhone gets your location and 
communicates the location back to the owner. 
Note that GPS may need be enabled and the phone within view of the sky for an 
accurate location to be obtained. 
The app will fall back to using Google's network location API, but we recommend
you disable that nonfree software anyway. 
Currently supports activating by sending a secret
message via SMS or an email to [[org.fdroid.k9]] (or the official K-9 build,
depending on the version you install). 
The resulting location is sent via SMS.

Status: Beta.
