Summary:GPS, sensor and network status
Description:
A diagnostic tool that displays data reported by sensors in the phone.

GPS:
* Location, speed, bearing and error
* Satellites in view and satellites used
* Time to first fix and time of last fix

Sensors (as supported by your phone):
* Accelerometer (acceleration and gravity)
* Rotation
* Magnetic field
* Orientation (azimuth, pitch and roll)
* Ambient temperature
* Pressure
* Relative humidity
* Ambient light
* Proximity

Networks:
* GSM/CDMA cells in range
* WiFi networks in range
* Signal strength

Known limitations:
* Some phones will report only the network cell with which they are currently
registered. On such phones you will only see one cell under "GSM" or "CDMA".
This is a limitation of the phone's radio firmware, and SatStat has no way of
getting more information from the device.
