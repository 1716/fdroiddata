Auto Name:AsciiCam
Summary:ASCII text pictures
Description:
AsciiCam generates ASCII images in real time from whatever your camera is
pointing at, either in greyscale, in the primary colors or in full color.

You can also create ASCII versions of pictures in your gallery, and optionally
have ASCII versions automatically generated every time you take a picture with
the standard camera app.
