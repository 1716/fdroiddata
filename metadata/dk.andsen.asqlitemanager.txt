Summary:SQLite (small database) Frontend
Description:
Front end allowing management of SQLite databases. These are very commonly used by apps to store settings in the /data directory, but you would need root access to move them to a location that this app can edit them from. If you try to enter that directory with this app's file manager it suggests you install aShell to do it directly, but we don't have that in the repo as it is not FOSS
.
