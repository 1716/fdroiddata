Summary:Money management
Description:
A companion application for the desktop app Gnucash. It allows you to record
transactions on-the-go and export them in the OFX format and later import the
data into Gnucash for the desktop. You can create multiple accounts for
transactions in Gnucash. 

N.B. The 1.0 is actually the first beta. Subsequent betas don't have
a different version code so we can't supply them.
