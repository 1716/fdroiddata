Summary:Schedule viewer for events
Description:
'''N.B'''You can try v0.999.999 if you're on Android 4; it could be the 
current version but it is hard to tell. However, v0.99.999
works fine and on Android 2 also: you won't get pinch to zoom in
the block schedule though.

An application that loads xcal/Pentabarf XML files (that contain schedules 
of conferences/festivals/other events) and lets you browse them in various 
convenient formats. Preloaded with data for FOSDEM.

The source code isn't visible from a browser; it needs to be cloned with bzr.
