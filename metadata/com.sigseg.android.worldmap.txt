Summary:Display a world map
Description:
WorldMap is a simple Android app that displays [a map http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg]
of the world taken from Wikimedia and allows the user to scroll around on it.
The map is from wikipedia and licensed as PD-USGOV; PD-USGOV-CIA-WF - more info [here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg])

The map itself is quite large (6480,3888), so it’s way too big to fit in
memory all at once (over 48MB). The VM heap size Android supports is either 16
or 24 megs, so we can’t fit the whole thing in memory at once.

WorldMap uses the BitmapRegionDecoder API (available as of API 10) to decode
just what it needs to display.
