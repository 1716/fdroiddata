Summary:Dictaphone with text-to-speech for Estonian
Description:
Features include tagging, a high quality built-in voice recorder, the possibility to 
use an external recorder app and recording manager app. In addition, it can connect to an 
online Estonian speech-to-text service (http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/webtrans/) to turn the recordings 
into written text. In addition to providing the transcription, this service also detects speakers 
in the recordings. This allows for novel and powerful ways to search, sort and playback the recordings, e.g
you can easily locate in your set of recordings all the paragraphs where given words are mentioned, 
and then playback these paragraphs; you can sort your recordings by how many speakers they feature;
you can "scroll" the recording to see where one speaker finishes and the next starts, useful when listening to
 podcasts or press conferences with multiple speakers.
