Summary:Control your phone via GTalk/XMPP
Description:
Send/receive SMS, make calls, locate your phone via GPS, activate WLAN or
Bluetooth, etc. It can be useful for those who prefer typing SMS on a real
keyboard. The app also notifies you about new "events" on the phone, like a
new text message (SMS) or an incoming call. Think of it as an remote control
for your android phone via GTalk/XMPP that informs you about recent events on
your smartphone.
