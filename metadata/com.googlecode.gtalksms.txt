Summary:Control your phone via GTalk/XMPP
description:Send/receive SMS, make calls, locate your phone via GPS, activate WLAN or Bluetooth, etc. It can be useful for those who prefer typing sms on a real keyboard. The app also notifies you about new "events" on the phone, like a new text message (SMS) or an incoming call. Think of it as an remote control for your android phone via GTalk/XMPP that informs you about recent events on your smartphone.
