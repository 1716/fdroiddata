Summary:Secure Messaging Application For Mobile Devices
Description:
This Instant Messenger has a built-in end-to-end point encryption,
which means every outgoing message is only readable by your contact.

On the installation the application creates a key pair on your phone device.
One Public-Key and a Private-Key, with the Public-Key you can encrypt messages but you cannot decrypt it.
Decryption is only possible with your Private-Key.

This method is called Public-key cryptography and will be used all over the world. So why shouldn't we used that also for our Instant Messaging?!

Have fun and please report any bug or maybe feature you find :)
