Summary:Wireless adb
Description:
adbWireless lets you access your phone through adb without the need of a wired
USB connection. The app provides you with the phone's local IP address so that
you can use it on your computer to connect to it. Beware, the access will be
granted to all devices on the same wireless network - it would not be sensible
to activate this service on any network that is not of your best trust.

A simple toggle widget is included.

Requires Root: Yes.
