Summary:Play music across the network
Description:
Connect to your Subsonic server and listen to your music 
wherever you go. 
Songs are cached for playback to save on your mobile bandwidth and to make 
them available when you have no connection at all.
* Lockscreen controls (ICS+)
* Gapless Playback (JB+)
* Notification prev/pause/next buttons
* Quick add/remove songs to playlist
* Pause playback when other apps request audio focus (navigation, etc)
* Option to gather logs and send them via email for newer versions of Android which don't allow 3rd party apps to gather another apps' logs any more
* Drag and drop songs to rearrange your playlist on the Now Playing tab
* User defined Cache Size, Network Timeout, and Buffer Length
.
