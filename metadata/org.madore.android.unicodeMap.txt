Summary:Browse and copy Unicode characters
Description:
UnicodeMap lets you browse Unicode characters by range and search for them by name,
display them (when Android has the font) and copy them to the clipboard. It can
also decode a string of Unicode characters to names.

This app is just the list of Unicode characters, arranged by block: you can
browse through them, enter them in a dedicated text field, and copy that field to
the clipboard (it works a bit the way Gucharmap does). There is also a primitive
search feature (to search on the character name). Of course, Android will only
properly display a minuscule fraction of the characters, but those that are not
properly displayed still “work” in the sense that you can copy them around or
whatever.

This is a very basic and limited program, and not much data is available
(essentially, only the character name, its code point and its general category).
The list of characters, on the other hand, is complete: the latest version has
the full Unicode 6.1 character set (all 110 181 of them). In particular, the
program is not limited to the first plane of Unicode (aka, 65536 codepoints):
you can copy-paste cuneiform if you like.
