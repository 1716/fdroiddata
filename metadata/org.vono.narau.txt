Summary:Japanese revision help
Description:
* A dictionary (Japanese/English,French,German,Dutch,Russian), based on JMDict (Japanese-Multilingual Dictionary)
* Hiragana/Katakana charts
* A Kana/Kanji drawing panel
* Kana/Kanji drill (English, French, Portuguese, Spanish). The kanjis informations comes from Kanjivg and KANJIDIC2 databases.

The databases need to be downloaded and the startup screen will show you what's needed (~20MiB). There
are scripts in the source repo for doing it too. There is a bug in v0.6 whereby the database would fail
to install if you have more than 2GiB of storage available: this is fixed in v0.7.
