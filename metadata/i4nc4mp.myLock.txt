Summary:Lockscreen replacement
Description:
The goal of myLock is to provide missing user-customization over the balance between keyguarding, 
convenience, & overall security, as well as personalization options on the lockscreen. We have built it and 
optimized it using android 2.0 enhancements and have tested it on Droid and Nexus One devices, with those 
particular hardware configurations in mind.
