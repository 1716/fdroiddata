Summary:Automatically adjust media volume
Description:
Automatically adjusts the media volume on connect and resets on disconnect. This is done so the stereo streaming audio will work properly. Intended primarily for car Bluetooth systems. Also automatically captures location information so you can find where you left your car. The location can also be automatically captured when exiting Car Mode on your Android device. The location can be read by any app that understands GPS data. Can read out text messages using Text To Speech (TTS) services while you are connected. Each paired Bluetooth device or virtual device (home dock, car dock, power connection, or headset plug) can be configured to your liking.

Android 2.2 and above. (There is a version for below this, but not here)
