Summary:Manage various Bluetooth functions
Description:
Automatically adjusts the media volume on connect and resets on disconnect. This is done so the stereo 
streaming audio will work properly. Intended primarily for car Bluetooth systems. It can read out 
text messages using Text To Speech (TTS) services while you are connected. Each paired Bluetooth 
device or virtual device (home dock, car dock, power connection,  or headset plug) can be configured to your liking.

A secondary feature is the ability to capture location information so you can find where you left your car. 
The location can also be automatically captured when exiting Car Mode on your Android device and read by  
any app that understands GPS data. 

Android 2.2 and above. (There is a version for earlier versions, but not here)
