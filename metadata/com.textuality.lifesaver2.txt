Summary:SMS and call log backup/restore
Description:
A simple way to transfer your SMS and call logs to another phone via the sdcard. We don't have version 2.0
of Lifesaver2 which can transfer the data via the authors instance of a Google App Engine server as it
requires tokens that aren't in the source.
.
