Summary:Navigation for ozf2/3 maps
Description:
Navigation client that uses OziExplorer maps (ozf2, ozfx3).
Great for hiking, geocaching, off-roading, sailing, boating and other outdoor 
activities. You are expected to be aware of OziExplorer or at least of where to 
get its maps. Maps also can be created by yourself, but with some effort: see 
FAQ and wiki on the website for details. Online OpenStreetMap (OSM) maps are 
provided by default. Also hosted on 
[https://github.com/andreynovikov GitHub.com].
