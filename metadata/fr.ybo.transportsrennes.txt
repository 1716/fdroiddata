Summary:Transport info and navigation in France
Description:
Transports Rennes provides quick access to information about public 
transportation of the city of Rennes, France and its sprawl. 
Information comes from the open data initiative by Keolis Rennes, the
company running Rennes’ public transportation system.

Features:
* Bus and metro schedule (widget available for even faster access)
* Bus/metro itinerary computation
* Nearby bus stops and “LE vélo STAR” bikesharing stations
* Number of available bikes in “LE vélo STAR” stations
* Favorite bus stops, metro and bikesharing stations management
* Available parking space in park-and-ride facilities
* Disruption of service alerts and Twitter stream (@starbusmetro)

This build does not have Google Maps, so that users of phones without Google Maps
can still install it. The branch was provided by the author but hasn't been tested
as extensively as the default branch.
