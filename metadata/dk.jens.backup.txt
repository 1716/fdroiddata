Auto Name:openbackup
Summary:Backup manager
Description:
Make backups of selected apps on your device and restore from those backups.
oandbackup makes you able to save app data to a user-accessible location. 
Both backup / restore of single apps and of multiple apps are supported.

Requires a working busybox and rsync installation at the moment (often pre-installed on custom roms).

NB: Please notice a change in the name of the backup folder between versions 0.1.13 and 0.1.13.1.
Renaming the folder from "oabackups" to "oandbackups" upon updating will solve potential problems.

(As this app is still in an early phase, please don't rely on it solely unless you know what you are doing.)
