Summary:Sync your Facebook Contacts
Description:
To configure, go to "Settings => Accounts & Sync => Add Account".
Depending on how many friends you have, the first import might take a while, so be patient.

* Facebook does not allow to export phone numbers or emails. Only names, pictures and statuses are synced.
* Facebook users have the option to block one or all apps. If they opt for that, they will be EXCLUDED from your friends list.
* Does NOT work on Samsung Galaxy SIII

Status: The most recent versions use a proprietary library, so we can't build them.
