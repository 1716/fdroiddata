Summary:Data collection tools
Description:
Sample blank surveys can be downloaded within the app.

Open Data Kit (ODK) is a cross-platform set of tools which help organizations author, 
field, and manage mobile data collection solutions. ODK provides an out-of-the-box solution for users to:

* Build a data collection form or survey;
* Collect the data on a mobile device and send it to a server; and
* Aggregate the collected data on a server and extract it in useful formats.

In addition to socio-economic and health surveys with GPS locations and images, ODK is being used to 
create decision support for clinicians and for building multimedia-rich nature mapping tools. See 
featured deployments and list of tools for more examples of what the ODK community is doing. We welcome 
and encourage participation from the user community.
