Summary:Tor (anonymity) client
Description:
Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network surveillance that 
threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships.

Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local SOCKS or HTTP proxy. You can choose which apps go via
the proxy in the settings. On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent i.e  the app
that accesses the network need not be aware of the proxy's existence. If you don't have root access, we have 
some apps that are designed to work closely with Tor, such as Gibberbot Instant Messenger and the Orweb 
browser. There is also a proxy configurator addon for Firefox, called ProxyMob.

#We are using their binaries, but they have not published any since
#0.2.3.10-alpha-1.0.7-FINAL
#Normally they would be at https://www.torproject.org/docs/android.html.en#Manual
#where it says "You can download our most recent version of Orbot"
#We should probably switch this to source build.
