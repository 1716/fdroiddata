Summary:Tor (anonymity) client
Description:
Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network surveillance that 
threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships.

Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS SOCKS] or HTTP proxy. 
On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent i.e the app that accesses the network need 
not be aware of the proxy's existence. You can choose which apps go via the proxy in the settings. If you 
don't have root access, we have some apps that are designed to work closely with Tor, such as 
[[info.guardianproject.otr.app.im]] and [[info.guardianproject.browser]]. There is also a proxy configurator 
addon for [[org.mozilla.firefox]] or [[org.mozilla.firefox_beta]] called 
[https://github.com/guardianproject/ProxyMob/downloads ProxyMob] (not yet
available from the Mozilla addon site).

If you are using Android 4.1 you may need to check Use Default Iptables in the
Preferences.
