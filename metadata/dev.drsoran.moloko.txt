Summary:Remember the Milk client

The goal of the app is to support nearly all features provided by the RTM web application. Moloko 
accesses all tasks via a local database. Network connection is only necessary for background 
synchronization. Currently it supports German, English and French language.

rememberthemilk.com is a website that helps you manage todo lists. The app sets up an account provider
and you can choose read access or read/write access to your account.
