Auto Name:Liberario
Summary:Public transport routing
Description:
Public transport routing and consulting application initially written as a
drop-in replacement for Öffi, the popular non-free transport buddy.

In order to access public transport data, Liberario is using the
[public transport enabler http://code.google.com/p/public-transport-enabler/]
library, written and used by the Öeffi developer. This way, you should find no
difference in number of cities and areas supported in the two apps.

Status: Alpha. It has many bugs and a lot of functionality is still missing.
There is no guarantee for the correctness of the data.
