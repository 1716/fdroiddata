Summary:Create and share soundboards
Description:
Boarder is an app for centralized and extensive control of soundboards - the aural equivalent of a painter's
palette. Itâ€™s also a tool for easily building and sharing rich soundboards. Dropbox support will not work, due to the fact that api keys are not distributable in the source by F-droid.

This is still beta. Internet features are not fully tested and documentation is not good. Minor known bugs 
included.
