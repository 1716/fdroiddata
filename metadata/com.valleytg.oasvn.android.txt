Summary:SVN for Android
Description:
The first functional SVN (Subversion) client for Android that correctly uses the SVN protocol! 
Works for http:// https:// and svn:// repositories! svn+ssh:// has been added, please email me with 
input on it. Currently supports all of the following svn operations: Checkout (Head or specify revision), 
Update, Commit, Export (Head or specify revision), Cleanup, and Revert. Also allows you to view remote 
repository revisions (you specify the number of revisions to retrieve) and see commit comments, author, 
date/time and all files changed, added, deleted, etc.

Working copies and exports of repositories are saved locally (all checked out files will go to your 
mountable storage: most of the time /mnt/sdcard/OASVN) so they could be edited on your device with an IDE such as Terminal IDE and then you can commit back to your repository!

The most recent version adds svn export so you can make a local copy of your repository on your Android 
device without making a working svn copy. Also the revisions list now prompts for the number of revisions 
to retrieve from the remote server. Finally you can checkout or export specific revisions besides the 
head version.

The interface has been reworked a bit to include a menu for some functions to clean up the main screen. 
Also improved is the German language support. Currently we are looking for help with French, Japanese and 
Russian translations, if you can help, there is more information at these links:

[http://www.valleytg.com:8090/browse/OASVN-35 French]
[http://www.valleytg.com:8090/browse/OASVN-15 Russian]
[http://www.valleytg.com:8090/browse/OASVN-14 Japanese]

We have taken every precaution to ensure this works correctly, but please make sure to back up your 
repositories regularly!

This project is only a couple of months old now and has been growing quickly. A 
[http://www.valleytg.com/jira JIRA] has been created to help keep the project moving along. 

Note: svn+ssl is still experimental. I have received some positive feedback but I do not have access 
to do in-depth testing yet on this protocol, please send any feedback using the Jira.
