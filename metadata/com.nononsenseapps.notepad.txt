Name:NoNonsenseNotes
Summary:Simple notepad
Description:
N.B. The syncing with Google Tasks won't work because there are
no API keys in the source code. That means there isn't a way of
backing up your notes, at least until v4 arrives. That is, unless
you have root access.

Notepad and todo list app with a modern look.
