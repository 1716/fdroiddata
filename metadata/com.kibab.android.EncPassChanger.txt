Summary:Use a stronger disk password
Description:
In Android 4.0.3+ it is now possible to encrypt the storage so that a password is necessary to decrypt
it every time the phone is switched on. However, in stock Android, the password used to generate the 
encryption key is identical to that used to unlock the screen. That either forces you to use weak 
password, or to type long secure password each time you unlock the screen of device. 
This application uses standard VDC calls to validate and set a new password. The app has 
been tested on the developer's Galaxy Nexus: however, please backup your data before using this app! 
If you forget your password, you will NEVER recover your data!
