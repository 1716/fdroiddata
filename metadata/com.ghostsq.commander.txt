Auto Name:Ghost Commander
Summary:Dual-panel file manager
Description:
Dual panel file manager, like Norton Commander, Midnight Commander or
Total Commander. Unlike regular file managers, it copies and moves
files between its two panels.

The file manager can also create or extract ZIP archives and transfer
files to/from FTP servers.
The SFTP/SMB network share functionalities need
plugin apps that aren't yet in the f-droid.org repo.
There is also a handy app manager featuring package names,
installation dates, sharing apks (via long-press), manifests and
access to activities and shortcuts.

Requires root: No, but if you allow it root you can remount filesystems,
and mess around with the system files.
