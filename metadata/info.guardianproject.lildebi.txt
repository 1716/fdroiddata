Summary:Run Debian on your phone
Description:
This is an app to setup and manage a Debian install in parallel on an Android
phone.  It can build a Debian install from scratch or use an existing image.
It manages the starting and stopping of the Debian install. It uses debootstrap 
to build up the disk image as a chroot, and then providesstart and stop methods 
for handling mounting, fsck, starting/stopping sshd, etc.. This is built from
source by f-droid except for the gpg part which can be built from the code in
info.guardianproject.gpg.txt in the fdroiddata repo. See the website for usage 
instructions.  This is currently functional alpha software, so do not rely on it 
to produce a trusted Debian install.  Please do try it out, use it, and report 
criticisms, bugs, improvements, etc.
