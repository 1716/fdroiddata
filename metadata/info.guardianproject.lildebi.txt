Summary:Run Debian on your phone
Description:
This is an app to setup and manage a Debian install in parallel on an Android
phone. It can build a Debian install from scratch or use an existing image.
It manages the starting and stopping of the Debian install. It uses debootstrap 
to build up the disk image as a chroot, and then provides start and stop methods 
for handling mounting, fsck, starting/stopping sshd, etc.. When the installation begins it 
is best to turn off the screen timeout and not to do anything else. 

This is built from source by f-droid except for the gpg part which can be built from the instructions in the 
[http://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroiddata/blobs/master/metadata/info.guardianproject.gpg.txt metadata]
in the fdroiddata repo. See the website for full usage instructions: or try running $su then #debian in 
[[jackpal.androidterm]] after mounting the image.

This is currently functional alpha software, so do not rely on it to produce a trusted Debian install.  
Please do try it out, use it, and report criticisms, bugs, improvements, etc.
