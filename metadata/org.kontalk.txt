Summary:Community-driven instant messaging network
Description:
** DO NOT INSTALL ON SD CARD **
** Follow @kontalknet on Twitter to be updated on service status! **

Kontalk is an instant messaging system - primarly designed for embedded
devices, especially smartphones. It is designed to be distributed, based on
community-driven infrastructure.
Send and receive messages for free with other Kontalk users.
Kontalk uses your phone number to identify yourself and automatically adds
other Kontalk users you can talk with by looking in your contact list.
You can send any text messages and image (other media types coming soon).
Even in server-to-client communication, your phone number is irreversibly
encrypted, so even we can't possibly know your phone number (it is used only
for sending you the verification code, than it will be discarded).
