Summary:Battery efficient GPS Logger
Description:
GPSLogger uses the GPS capabilities of your Android phone to log coordinates to a GPS or KML file at regular 
intervals. This can be particularly useful if you want to geotag your photos after a day out or share your 
travel route with someone. The purpose of this application is to be battery efficient to save you battery 
power when abroad and last as long as possible.

Unfortunately the app will crash if you attempt to upload tracks to Dropbox, Google or OSM as keys
for these services would need to be put in the source code before building and if we did that we could 
break their terms of service. Email still works, which works with with one press as long as the SMTP server
details are all entered correctly.
