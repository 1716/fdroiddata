Summary:Microblogging client for StatusNet/Twitter
Description:
Mustard is the first full-featured client for [http://status.net Statusnet], 
a microblogging platform somewhat like Twitter. 
Note that the largest Statusnet site, [http://identi.ca identi.ca], will 
on June 1st begin using a different platform called [http://pump.io pump.io]. 
That means that the currently available versions of Mustard won't work 
with identi.ca.

It has many features like attachments, geolocation and avatar update.
It supports tags, groups and public timelines, favor/disfavor notices,
subscribe/unsubscribe users and multiple accounts.

If the server uses OAuth the credentials will need to be put 
on a server as explained on the website.
